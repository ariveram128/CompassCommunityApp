# Privacy Policy for Compass Community

**Last Updated: July 2025**

## Introduction

Compass Community is built with privacy as our foundational principle. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our community safety reporting app, designed to protect both user privacy and community safety.

## Our Privacy-First Commitment

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII).** Every feature of Compass Community is designed to operate anonymously.

## Information We DO NOT Collect

- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect names, phone numbers, email addresses, or any other personal identifiers
- **No Account Creation**: The app works without requiring account registration or login
- **No User Tracking**: We do not track individual users across sessions or devices
- **No Behavioral Analytics**: We do not analyze individual user behavior or create user profiles
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: We do not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services

## Information We DO Process (Anonymously)

### Location Data

- **Anonymous Location Processing**: Your location is automatically anonymized to a ~100-meter grid before any processing
- **Local Processing Only**: Location data is processed entirely on your device
- **No Location Storage**: We do not store exact location coordinates
- **Purpose**: Used only for determining proximity to community reports and enabling location-based alerts

### Community Reports

- **Anonymous Reports**: All reports are submitted without any personal identifiers
- **Auto-Expiring**: Reports automatically delete after 4 hours
- **Location Anonymization**: Report locations are rounded to protect privacy
- **Device Fingerprinting Prevention**: We use temporary, anonymous device identifiers that reset regularly

### Verification System

- **Anonymous Participation**: Community verification occurs without identifying individual users
- **Trust Metrics**: Trust scores are calculated using anonymous, aggregated data
- **No Personal Profiles**: Verification history is not tied to personal information

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only

- All data is stored locally on your device
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No cloud storage or backup of personal information
- Data is automatically purged after expiration periods

### Security Measures

- **Encryption**: All local data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption
- **No Backend Dependencies**: The app operates without requiring server communication
- **Anonymous Device IDs**: Device identifiers are hashed and rotated regularly
- **Secure Communication**: When peer-to-peer communication is used, it employs end-to-end encryption

## Notifications

### Push Notifications

- **Location-Based Alerts**: Notifications are triggered by proximity to anonymous reports
- **No Personal Data**: Notification content contains no personal information
- **User Control**: All notifications can be disabled in app settings
- **Anonymous Delivery**: Notification tokens are not linked to personal information

## Third-Party Services

### Minimal Third-Party Integration

- **Maps**: We use mapping services for display purposes only (no location data transmitted)
- **Operating System Services**: We integrate with device location and notification services with explicit user permission
- **No Analytics Services**: We do not use third-party analytics, crash reporting, or advertising services

### No Data Sharing

- We do not share any data with third parties
- We do not sell data to advertisers or data brokers
- We do not participate in data sharing agreements

## User Rights and Controls

### User Control

- **Disable Location**: Location services can be disabled at any time
- **Clear Data**: Users can clear all local data through the app
- **Notification Control**: All notification types can be individually controlled
- **Opt-Out**: Users can stop using the app at any time without any data persistence

### Data Deletion

- **Automatic Deletion**: All reports and data automatically expire and delete
- **Manual Deletion**: Users can manually clear all app data at any time
- **Uninstall**: Uninstalling the app removes all associated data

## Technical Privacy Measures

### Privacy by Design

- **Anonymous by Default**: All features operate anonymously from the ground up
- **Data Minimization**: We collect only the minimum data necessary for functionality
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data is used only for its stated purpose
- **Storage Limitation**: All data has automatic expiration periods

### Technical Safeguards

- **Location Fuzzing**: GPS coordinates are automatically rounded to protect exact locations
- **Temporal Privacy**: Reports include only approximate time stamps
- **Anonymous Aggregation**: All analytics are performed on anonymous, aggregated data
- **Secure Random Generation**: All identifiers use cryptographically secure random generation

## Legal Compliance

### Jurisdiction

This app operates under United States privacy laws and is designed to exceed compliance requirements for:

- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles
- Other applicable state and federal privacy regulations

### Law Enforcement

- **No Personal Data to Share**: We cannot provide personal information to law enforcement because we do not collect it
- **Anonymous Reports**: Community reports contain no identifying information
- **Legal Limitations**: We comply with lawful requests but have no personal data to disclose

## Children's Privacy

- **No Age Verification**: We do not collect age information
- **No Special Procedures**: Since we collect no personal information, no special procedures are needed for minors
- **COPPA Compliance**: Our anonymous approach inherently complies with children's privacy requirements

## International Users

- **Global Privacy**: Our privacy-first approach protects users regardless of location
- **No Cross-Border Data Transfer**: Since we collect no personal data, there are no international data transfer concerns
- **Local Compliance**: Users remain subject to their local laws regarding app usage

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

- **Notification of Changes**: Any material changes will be clearly communicated through app updates
- **Enhanced Privacy**: We commit to only making changes that maintain or enhance privacy protections
- **User Choice**: Users can always choose to stop using the app if they disagree with policy changes
