## üìã Development Process

### 1. Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ice-community-alert.git
cd ice-community-alert

# Install dependencies
npm install
npx expo install

# Start development server
npx expo start
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Create branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# For security improvements
git checkout -b security/vulnerability-fix
```

### 3. Development Guidelines

#### Privacy-First Code Standards

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Anonymized location data
const anonymizedLocation = {
  latitude: Math.round(coords.latitude * 1000) / 1000,
  longitude: Math.round(coords.longitude * 1000) / 1000,
  timestamp: Date.now()
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Storing exact location with user data
const userLocation = {
  userId: "12345",
  exactLat: coords.latitude,
  exactLng: coords.longitude,
  deviceId: device.uniqueId
};
```

#### Security Requirements

- **No logging of personal data**: Location, device info, or user behavior
- **Encryption for sensitive data**: Use Expo SecureStore for any persistent data
- **Input validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **Error handling**: Don't expose system information in error messages

#### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use type annotations for new code
- **Comments**: Document privacy and security decisions
- **Testing**: Add tests for privacy-critical functions
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines

### 4. Testing Requirements

#### Before Submitting PR

```bash
# Run test suite
npm test

# Test on both platforms
npx expo start --android
npx expo start --ios

# Check TypeScript
npx tsc --noEmit

# Lint code
npm run lint
```
